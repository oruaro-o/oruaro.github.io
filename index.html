(CUSTOMER CARE FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND ORGANIZATIONS MODULE 1) 

INSTRUCTOR:ELIZABETH NYAH

Hello, thank you very much for joining me on this course thank you for signing up, I'm sure that we are going to have a very good ride. Today we're going to be focusing on understanding service excellence. It's a topic I'm very passionate about, because it forms the core of business or Bible, like we know every business exists to serve the need of a customer, you know, and in identity in the customer, I true the customer acquisition process to the service, you know, to the appreciation and the feedback, service excellence, it's at its core. So I'm hoping at the end of this programme, in fact, that's my one objective, you know, big to be able to infect you with a service excellence bug. So let me know how successful I have been in at doing just that. So through the course of this programme, we're going to be looking at a couple of things we're going to be touching on understanding what service is about, we're going to be looking at a customer developing a customer service attitude, we're going to be looking at stayin energise positive, and going the extra mile for the customer, we'll be looking at how to implement a service strategy as a competitive advantage, we'll take a short look at customer service in person on telephone, email as the rest of that, we'll also take a quick look at the customer Winback approach. So please join me as we jump right in. So in defining our course objectives, at the end of the session, were spec all participants to be able to understand the business case for customer experience, to be able to evaluate the business current experience level. In other words, it's not just a topic for the books, it's something that no matter the skill of your business, or your hospital, or your practice, you know, you should be able to implement some of this learning. So we're looking at evaluating the business current experience level, how to identify or develop a client or a patient experience, strategy, culture and implementation plan, we'll also be taking a look at classifying patients, or clients identifying and delivering on DNA because you'd agree with me that customers want different things, I mean, the context of the hospital, the lab practice, the diagnostic shop, whatever it is, you know, your customers want different needs, and to be able to meet those needs, effectively, you should be able to pacify them. Accordingly, we are looking at how to embrace a customer service, attitude service excellent as a salary service, and communication cues for those in the service role. That also would look at mitigating service staff. That's how to craft a patient or client when but strategy because you'd agree with me, no matter how lofty goals or for the business, you know, there are going to be cases of customer disappointment. So even when you lose them, you know, you shouldn't just stop it that he should have a customer or a client or patient when bad strategy, then also, communication is never complete until there is feedback. So we'll also be taking a look at how to institute feedback channels for continuous improvement. So before we jump right, in the million dollar question, who is the customer? And what Why the fuss about service excellence? And I'll tell you why. You know, there's been recent studies that indicated that from 2020, in fact, that's last year, customer experience would would overtake prices, products or services as a key brand differentiator. So if currently your business or your hospital or your practice is not developing or putting all in high investments in ensuring that you have a customer experience strategy, you know, very soon we are going to be out of business because we have learned that it's gone beyond a nice to have to a key brand differentiator. So we are going to be looking at service excellence and we have so much suppose about service, excellent customer experience. And what does this really mean to the client and now you've adopted a quite a simple definition that almost everybody can relate to it. It's the end to end orientation of excellent patients expectation, first time and every time. So what does this mean? You know, I've deliberately put some words in highlight to be able to emphasise a bit more so maybe I should start from end to end. So as against contrary to popular opinion, service excellence translates the service desk, you know, so it's not just about the person how warm and nice and sweet the person is. And we're going to be looking at that in detail as we go ahead. You know, so if the end to end right from the very first experience the customer existing prospective Has with your brand. You know, that's where it starts from, up until the Soul Cycle of the service process. So from identification, delivery, and like we say that introduction of the feedback. And secondly, service excellence, or customer experience is an orientation, right. So it's beyond a job role. It's a culture. And with all elements of culture, we know that it is inspired from the top. Now, let me explain that very quickly with an example. So yes, you have a customer experience strategy, your goal is to make sure that you have great customer reviews, and all that. But with your processes, there are so many bottlenecks with your core processes. So maybe it's your run a hospital practice, and you have find that most times your pharmacy rose out of stock of key drugs, you know, or prescription. So what will happen is, that would affect the customer experience to some extent, because you'll find out that for your clients, you'll always have to go sourcing, so it's like you are not a one stop shop, as it were, or if maybe for reasons, for several reasons, depending, again, like I said, it's something that is an element that is key to the survival of a business. So it should be looked at for this differently. So maybe when your customers come to your lab, you know, you're trying to be economical. So there is no, for those in this part of the world, that's power issues, they have to keep finding themselves, or when you tell them to come for their results at three o'clock, they come at three, I apologise saying you know, so regardless of how nice and sweet you are, with their apologies, you know, that is a service gap. So it's like I said, it's an orientation, and the tone is set from the top. So for the person at the top of key leadership, whoever has this, the responsibility of delivering business or gets it, that person needs to understand that everything I do everything I don't do, the tone that I use in communicating my staff, my commitment to ensuring that their standard operating procedures, you know, all have an impact on service excellence. And, well, let's move over to the word exceeding. So what does it mean? The truth is, every business has competitors, of course, you are in, maybe with the exception, of course, you are in a monopoly, right. But if you are not in a monopoly, then you will have competitors. And don't forget also that your competitors are not sleeping, right. So even as no matter how lofty, and how exciting your customer experience strategy is, someone else is thinking. So for you to be and it's the same market, basically. So for you to be able to make sure that you are festival meeting, before we talk of exceeding you know, that is what would give you an edge. So it's beyond meeting because that's basic, there are certain expectations that the customer or the client or the patient would have. So the goal of Work customer experience, or service excellence strategy is to exceed patient expectations.

 
And you know, again, I tell you, again, briefly put first time, you know, and every time in highlight, because for some people, it's the beginning, right, they put everything in place to make sure that you have a great or your well first experience, while the second time because now the focus has shifted. And I hope that you can see when I say that it is a culture. So yes, the while you the first time you are happy, you're excited, and you go back and it is a disappointment. So what what it means is, you know, just like the story of the whitewash, right. So it's just a facade, it hasn't become a cultural or an orientation. So for you to get or reach your goal of service excellence, you should be able to make sure that it happens first time and every time and this can only happen if it has become a culture. So moving very quickly, before I get into the ABCs of service excellence. Someone shared a story with me MBI in the week, and it has to do really with instituting a culture of service excellence for a lot of businesses is going to start as a point of recruitment. If you've joined the HR course, you'll know that recruitment is key for survival of a business, the quality of people you bring on board, you should be deliberate to ensure that there are people that connect with your vision and excited about what you did no matter what every other person is saying about them. They told me that there was this company somewhere in the US their vision was to deliver happiness. Right. So regardless of the nature of their work, their goal was to deliver happiness to the customers or to the client and bond critical thing they did to ensure that they meet their goal or their vision is realised is at the point of focus on recruitment. Two other points of recruitment, one of the recruitment criteria is that they will require their candidates to dress funny, you know, funny like a clown, you don't just so that's just a test. And they tell you, let's see how creative you can get with your with with video dressing, let's see how far and the essence of doing that was to find out how far this particular employee would go to make a customer happy. So what they did at the end of the day, when they gave the job, all the conditions or selection criteria being in place, they get the job to the most creative, the ones that were, so to speak, clowning about, because they said this person would have no shame, literally speaking in making or Delivering Happiness. So like I said, I'm not asking you to ask or your staff or prospective candidate to begin to do funny things around town, what I'm saying is that you want to also, if you're looking to develop a customer oriented culture, you should make sure that at the point of recruitment, the kind of people you bring on board are those who are passionate about delivering service. And the healthcare sector, you know, is basically a niche on its own. So you're going to be having people who may be a challenge, you know, who are worried about your health and all that. So what more is like this is the perfect opportunity to be able to deliver happiness, as it were. So like I said, it goes beyond the front office is the whole experience. For instance, maybe you want a website, for instance. And so your customers should be able to travel, that's a first interaction with your business, right? And considering the way the world is moving the digitization, globalisation, globalisation, the rest. So when I checked the website, of I want to check for your branch location, your website should be up and running. If you say you have a website, it should be up and running. Right? So I haven't come to your premises physically. But that's an experience as a touch points, as your website should be up and running the telephone numbers, they should be reachable, right. So those already formed a perception of the kind of how how serious you are in delivering service excellence. So beyond putting a pretty nice, sweet person at the front office, you should be able to think of all your customer touch points, and be ready to deliver a great service. And like I said, with the research, the research statistics, or data, customer experience, or customer service, or service excellence is the new goal. Because like I said, it has become a key different different. A key differentiator, I'm sure that you are aware that if you are in healthcare practice, you know, you have competitors and new competitors are springing up every day. So you should be able to think what is your key competitive advantage. And we also ask adequately, that it is also not enough for you to focus on the external customer, because I'm sure that you are aware that there will be internal customers with your staff and respective teams working in your business. And external customer is the clients that you cater to. So these both of these parties have to work well. And you know, in delivering great service because if your study, there's infighting amongst your staff, there's lack of trust ups, poor communication, and it's going to affect service to the customer, for instance, maybe you run a shift system. So because not A and not B are not in good talking terms. You know, she's handing over and, and maybe in putting that down her notes, or call notes, you know that she misses out something. So she remembers on the way but because she's not there talking to him, with staff taking along as if she lives it. And that's could be a vital, you know, it contribution to ensuring that the patient gets adequate care. So these are some of the things to be able to look at. So very quickly, we're going to be jumping next into the ABCs of service excellence. But before we, before we jump right in, you know, it's also important to emphasise that so beyond getting customers to come back, it's a spirit. Right? And we like to say that we don't give what you don't have. So it's also important in emphasising the internal working relationship for the business owner or the manager or the leader to ensure that the workplace is the workplace environment, you know, is healthy, you know, it has to be healthy your team members have to feel excited about what you do. I'm not saying because the truth is there are no perfect businesses, but you know, you should do everything you can to make sure that your staff are comfortable because like Richard Branson said, you know, it says happy employees to give great customer service

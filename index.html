(CUSTOMER CARE FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND ORGANIZATIONS MODULE 1) 

INSTRUCTOR:ELIZABETH NYAH

Hello, thank you very much for joining me on this course thank you for signing up, I'm sure that we are going to have a very good ride. Today we're going to be focusing on understanding service excellence. It's a topic I'm very passionate about, because it forms the core of business or Bible, like we know every business exists to serve the need of a customer, you know, and in identity in the customer, I true the customer acquisition process to the service, you know, to the appreciation and the feedback, service excellence, it's at its core. So I'm hoping at the end of this programme, in fact, that's my one objective, you know, big to be able to infect you with a service excellence bug. So let me know how successful I have been in at doing just that. So through the course of this programme, we're going to be looking at a couple of things we're going to be touching on understanding what service is about, we're going to be looking at a customer developing a customer service attitude, we're going to be looking at stayin energise positive, and going the extra mile for the customer, we'll be looking at how to implement a service strategy as a competitive advantage, we'll take a short look at customer service in person on telephone, email as the rest of that, we'll also take a quick look at the customer Winback approach. So please join me as we jump right in. So in defining our course objectives, at the end of the session, were spec all participants to be able to understand the business case for customer experience, to be able to evaluate the business current experience level. In other words, it's not just a topic for the books, it's something that no matter the skill of your business, or your hospital, or your practice, you know, you should be able to implement some of this learning. So we're looking at evaluating the business current experience level, how to identify or develop a client or a patient experience, strategy, culture and implementation plan, we'll also be taking a look at classifying patients, or clients identifying and delivering on DNA because you'd agree with me that customers want different things, I mean, the context of the hospital, the lab practice, the diagnostic shop, whatever it is, you know, your customers want different needs, and to be able to meet those needs, effectively, you should be able to pacify them. Accordingly, we are looking at how to embrace a customer service, attitude service excellent as a salary service, and communication cues for those in the service role. That also would look at mitigating service staff. That's how to craft a patient or client when but strategy because you'd agree with me, no matter how lofty goals or for the business, you know, there are going to be cases of customer disappointment. So even when you lose them, you know, you shouldn't just stop it that he should have a customer or a client or patient when bad strategy, then also, communication is never complete until there is feedback. So we'll also be taking a look at how to institute feedback channels for continuous improvement. So before we jump right, in the million dollar question, who is the customer? And what Why the fuss about service excellence? And I'll tell you why. You know, there's been recent studies that indicated that from 2020, in fact, that's last year, customer experience would would overtake prices, products or services as a key brand differentiator. So if currently your business or your hospital or your practice is not developing or putting all in high investments in ensuring that you have a customer experience strategy, you know, very soon we are going to be out of business because we have learned that it's gone beyond a nice to have to a key brand differentiator. So we are going to be looking at service excellence and we have so much suppose about service, excellent customer experience. And what does this really mean to the client and now you've adopted a quite a simple definition that almost everybody can relate to it. It's the end to end orientation of excellent patients expectation, first time and every time. So what does this mean? You know, I've deliberately put some words in highlight to be able to emphasise a bit more so maybe I should start from end to end. So as against contrary to popular opinion, service excellence translates the service desk, you know, so it's not just about the person how warm and nice and sweet the person is. And we're going to be looking at that in detail as we go ahead. You know, so if the end to end right from the very first experience the customer existing prospective Has with your brand. You know, that's where it starts from, up until the Soul Cycle of the service process. So from identification, delivery, and like we say that introduction of the feedback. And secondly, service excellence, or customer experience is an orientation, right. So it's beyond a job role. It's a culture. And with all elements of culture, we know that it is inspired from the top. Now, let me explain that very quickly with an example. So yes, you have a customer experience strategy, your goal is to make sure that you have great customer reviews, and all that. But with your processes, there are so many bottlenecks with your core processes. So maybe it's your run a hospital practice, and you have find that most times your pharmacy rose out of stock of key drugs, you know, or prescription. So what will happen is, that would affect the customer experience to some extent, because you'll find out that for your clients, you'll always have to go sourcing, so it's like you are not a one stop shop, as it were, or if maybe for reasons, for several reasons, depending, again, like I said, it's something that is an element that is key to the survival of a business. So it should be looked at for this differently. So maybe when your customers come to your lab, you know, you're trying to be economical. So there is no, for those in this part of the world, that's power issues, they have to keep finding themselves, or when you tell them to come for their results at three o'clock, they come at three, I apologise saying you know, so regardless of how nice and sweet you are, with their apologies, you know, that is a service gap. So it's like I said, it's an orientation, and the tone is set from the top. So for the person at the top of key leadership, whoever has this, the responsibility of delivering business or gets it, that person needs to understand that everything I do everything I don't do, the tone that I use in communicating my staff, my commitment to ensuring that their standard operating procedures, you know, all have an impact on service excellence. And, well, let's move over to the word exceeding. So what does it mean? The truth is, every business has competitors, of course, you are in, maybe with the exception, of course, you are in a monopoly, right. But if you are not in a monopoly, then you will have competitors. And don't forget also that your competitors are not sleeping, right. So even as no matter how lofty, and how exciting your customer experience strategy is, someone else is thinking. So for you to be and it's the same market, basically. So for you to be able to make sure that you are festival meeting, before we talk of exceeding you know, that is what would give you an edge. So it's beyond meeting because that's basic, there are certain expectations that the customer or the client or the patient would have. So the goal of Work customer experience, or service excellence strategy is to exceed patient expectations.

 
And you know, again, I tell you, again, briefly put first time, you know, and every time in highlight, because for some people, it's the beginning, right, they put everything in place to make sure that you have a great or your well first experience, while the second time because now the focus has shifted. And I hope that you can see when I say that it is a culture. So yes, the while you the first time you are happy, you're excited, and you go back and it is a disappointment. So what what it means is, you know, just like the story of the whitewash, right. So it's just a facade, it hasn't become a cultural or an orientation. So for you to get or reach your goal of service excellence, you should be able to make sure that it happens first time and every time and this can only happen if it has become a culture. So moving very quickly, before I get into the ABCs of service excellence. Someone shared a story with me MBI in the week, and it has to do really with instituting a culture of service excellence for a lot of businesses is going to start as a point of recruitment. If you've joined the HR course, you'll know that recruitment is key for survival of a business, the quality of people you bring on board, you should be deliberate to ensure that there are people that connect with your vision and excited about what you did no matter what every other person is saying about them. They told me that there was this company somewhere in the US their vision was to deliver happiness. Right. So regardless of the nature of their work, their goal was to deliver happiness to the customers or to the client and bond critical thing they did to ensure that they meet their goal or their vision is realised is at the point of focus on recruitment. Two other points of recruitment, one of the recruitment criteria is that they will require their candidates to dress funny, you know, funny like a clown, you don't just so that's just a test. And they tell you, let's see how creative you can get with your with with video dressing, let's see how far and the essence of doing that was to find out how far this particular employee would go to make a customer happy. So what they did at the end of the day, when they gave the job, all the conditions or selection criteria being in place, they get the job to the most creative, the ones that were, so to speak, clowning about, because they said this person would have no shame, literally speaking in making or Delivering Happiness. So like I said, I'm not asking you to ask or your staff or prospective candidate to begin to do funny things around town, what I'm saying is that you want to also, if you're looking to develop a customer oriented culture, you should make sure that at the point of recruitment, the kind of people you bring on board are those who are passionate about delivering service. And the healthcare sector, you know, is basically a niche on its own. So you're going to be having people who may be a challenge, you know, who are worried about your health and all that. So what more is like this is the perfect opportunity to be able to deliver happiness, as it were. So like I said, it goes beyond the front office is the whole experience. For instance, maybe you want a website, for instance. And so your customers should be able to travel, that's a first interaction with your business, right? And considering the way the world is moving the digitization, globalisation, globalisation, the rest. So when I checked the website, of I want to check for your branch location, your website should be up and running. If you say you have a website, it should be up and running. Right? So I haven't come to your premises physically. But that's an experience as a touch points, as your website should be up and running the telephone numbers, they should be reachable, right. So those already formed a perception of the kind of how how serious you are in delivering service excellence. So beyond putting a pretty nice, sweet person at the front office, you should be able to think of all your customer touch points, and be ready to deliver a great service. And like I said, with the research, the research statistics, or data, customer experience, or customer service, or service excellence is the new goal. Because like I said, it has become a key different different. A key differentiator, I'm sure that you are aware that if you are in healthcare practice, you know, you have competitors and new competitors are springing up every day. So you should be able to think what is your key competitive advantage. And we also ask adequately, that it is also not enough for you to focus on the external customer, because I'm sure that you are aware that there will be internal customers with your staff and respective teams working in your business. And external customer is the clients that you cater to. So these both of these parties have to work well. And you know, in delivering great service because if your study, there's infighting amongst your staff, there's lack of trust ups, poor communication, and it's going to affect service to the customer, for instance, maybe you run a shift system. So because not A and not B are not in good talking terms. You know, she's handing over and, and maybe in putting that down her notes, or call notes, you know that she misses out something. So she remembers on the way but because she's not there talking to him, with staff taking along as if she lives it. And that's could be a vital, you know, it contribution to ensuring that the patient gets adequate care. So these are some of the things to be able to look at. So very quickly, we're going to be jumping next into the ABCs of service excellence. But before we, before we jump right in, you know, it's also important to emphasise that so beyond getting customers to come back, it's a spirit. Right? And we like to say that we don't give what you don't have. So it's also important in emphasising the internal working relationship for the business owner or the manager or the leader to ensure that the workplace is the workplace environment, you know, is healthy, you know, it has to be healthy your team members have to feel excited about what you do. I'm not saying because the truth is there are no perfect businesses, but you know, you should do everything you can to make sure that your staff are comfortable because like Richard Branson said, you know, it says happy employees to give great customer service

Having said that services beyond what happens at the service desk, it's important to establish the ABCs of service. Excellent. So from the person at the security post, to the Service Desk, or the welcome desk, through all of the customer, touch points, whether it's the pharmacy, whether it's the lab, when it's done consulting, equipment, consultants, you know, whether it's the billing executive, whatever it is, all of this, team members have some level of interaction with the customer. So they should be able to understand the elements of service. Excellent. So the ABCs, like a point in here for easy recall, stands for E, the E stands for attitude, the B stands for business knowledge, and C for customer oriented or customer focused, and I'll explain so because I've laid the foundation earlier, that customer service is beyond what you do, it's who you ask, the more about the attitude of the business. So regardless of how passionate the particular team member is about satisfying the customer, if the business doesn't embrace this culture as a whole, it's going to affect, you know, the person on the receiving end. So the customer, the patient, or the client, and I mentioned that the tone, as with all matters of culture is sets from leadership. So what body signal or what body language? Does the personality topics yield? When it comes to customer? How was this the lead, or the precedent or whatever, that the chief consultant been able to translate the spirit into team members, and it has to do with things like approvals, things like ensuring team members have clearly defined job descriptions, and KPIs to measure everybody's contribution in things like ensuring the process is bottleneck free? So is it just one person that is able to sign little things like your petty cash disbursement? When there is a need for fuel, there's a need for powering the generator, there's a need your procurement processes, all of these, like, earlier mentioned, affect the customer experience? So what's the attitude of the business and like it's trans, it transcends just one person? So the second is the business knowledge of what everybody at a customer touch point, how versatile is the person about the business? Or is it a situation where maybe it's a customer is calling the Service Desk, okay, so I get your website, I see a number. And I want to confirm if you're going to be open at certain times, you know, what the day of the week, and the person is saying, oh, sorry, I have to confirm from my manager, I have to confirm from my supervisor, some of these things are turn offs, when it comes to interacting with customer. So for everybody, at customer touch point, the person should have a general overview of how the business runs and veteran should be versatile, you know, in that particular role. So the other is customer orientation, which we talked about being a culture, then also the one two threes of service is number one deal with one customer at the time, there's a certain bank that adopted the freeze of the one customer, the one customer bank, and at the end of the day, that's what service excellence is about. It's about appreciating the uniqueness of a customer, and dealing with that customer as if she's the only one or he's the only one on the planet at that particular time. There's nothing more frustrating than a customer trying to get the attention of a business or an executive, you know, and the person they say, oh, sorry, I have the patience to deal with Hurry up. And we see this happen very typically in a public institution. So you're not the only one here, you're taking up too much time. If that person had a choice, that person wouldn't come back to your business or to your practice. So that's one of the elements of a one to three of customers and you deal with that customer base on how uniqueness or his uniqueness and I see if she or he is the only one that exists at that particular time. Then secondly, understand that customer service is a two way exchange. So like As with all matters of communication, you know, you are you need something from the customer and this customer needs something from you. In fact, at the end of this course, we'll be looking at a quote by Mahatma Ghandi and he says the cost of an extract is that the customer is the most important person on our premises. You know he's not dependent on us we are dependent on him but in this context is good to know that the customer desires my view and you desire business because your business is what you will use the exchange you get for that value is the revenue is the experience and most importantly the reference. We're going to be looking at getting repeat business you know by leveraging service excellence as a strategy later on in the course, then solving identifying issues in three minutes or less. So yes, while it's important to emphasise that I know that there are issues that will take beyond three minutes, but there should be an escalation monitoring. So depending on the orientation of your team, depending on the level of inquiries that come in, they should be like a standard. So they are issues that on the desk can be resolved. So for a matter that can be resolved on that particular service desk, there is no point escalating, if you have to escalate and show that you are communicating and giving an estimated time, you know, to resolve the issue if you are not sure you can tell the customer okay? I'm not you know, there is no the most haha record in a wonderful better word. The strategy is to be transparent to treat the customer like family, so to speak. So yes, I know that you're not going to go out spill your gasoline, and maybe your manager made a blunder and all that. But there is a way that can be communicated that the customers to fuse carry that long, then there's also a concept of under promising and over delivery, right. So don't say you're going to deliver 103% When you only have capacity for 20%. So that's also very important. So yes, while you may not be solving the entire issues, we'll make sure that within three minutes at most, there is communication to the customer. So we're going to be looking at a few more elements of service excellence is creates uniqueness, like we said, customer experience is now a competitive advantage. So maybe one one other thing that can put your business, right, or if you are a manager, you can use to put team members on their toes, if you want to find out, you know what your peers are, what your competitors are building. So if you're a lab, for instance, and others are taking taking trades for hours to deliver a particular result to the use of technology, if you're able to make that investment, can you do yours? Same way or even better, not compromising any standard in 12 hours. So you need to be able to look through your business. I'm not asking you to make a reasonable investment. But now just look through, you know, it could even be the way you welcome your customers, it could be the way you run your loyalty programmes it will be you know, so whatever it is just look through, I'm sure that if you look you'd find their key, if key different differentiators that can be embraced so to speak. So to be to be able to deliver excellent remember, even the concept of excellence has to do with exceeding expectation to strive as a business to be better, to be faster and to be different. Because merely satisfying the customer we've talked about that is not good enough, because there are basic elements that every customer X expect. So if you think no through your processes, look through your people go through your standards, I'm sure that you find something that you can leverage as a differentiator, then secondly, you need to pay attention. And I wish I could emphasise this 100 times, right? So it's not about service or like we say business is not about what's going on in your mind what you think the customer wants. It's about what the customer really wants, when you when in designing your processes. You know, you should be able to ask do any feasibility, and it doesn't have to be anything elaborate. Take a sample, you know, who are the regular visitors to your premises? How you can ask the customer? How are we serving you? How would you assess us know, what do you want us to do? I remember the story now everybody is doing tests for the thing, the major the company that broke the tests innovation, that the plastic bottles, you know, for pop for bottling soda was Pepsi, right? And they had to they actually did a survey that made them understand that see customers or our target market or people that he has beyond them having nice time, you know, in restaurants I know that they don't appreciate, you know, something that is flexible, you know, so yes, I want to get a drink, I want to buy it home, I don't want to be worrying about exchanging bottles. And the rest of the other came up with the pets innovation, the plastic bottles and it's totally revolutionise you know, the soft drink or the soda industry. So you want to ask your customers or maybe you in asking them or maybe you want to also look at their behaviour, look at your patient behaviour, and what times of the week, do you have the highest volume of patient, you know, so

    
what can I do to reduce wait times? You know, so how can I leverage or how can we maybe if you realise that okay, so weekend's a high traffic for your practice. So maybe you want to introduce some incentive. for coming on a weekday, you know, so you need to pay attention to be able to design sustainable service, excellent practices. So that's about paying attention. Right? So also in recovery sales, we agree that it's not all going to be nice and sweet. It's not all going to be easy. But when that happens, how do you handle complaints? You know, is there a feedback system for customers who are dissatisfied with the quality of your product or your service? And also, what do you do with this feedback? A lot of businesses have lost the trust of customers existing and potential, because for previous feedback, they didn't do anything about it. Right? So how do you handle feedback? What's your system for communicating to the customer that, oh, thank you for this feedback with respect to x, y, and z. These are the strategies of these other systems, that the processes that we have put in place to ensure that, you know, we just improve from this point going forward. So you need to be able to make it easy for the customers to give you their feedback to improve your operational efficiency. And like we always say you need to emphasise your team members that feedback is a gift. Right? So imagine, you are talking to someone and you're the only one talking, we are not getting through the body language, the person is just blank, they're like a dummy, and it can be demoralising. And that's how some customers would feel interacting with your business. So it's just a one way, there is no interaction. So it's important to also institute some of this measures. So again, we mentioned that service is inside out. So what you understand by this, I gave the analogy, even if there's infighting in your team, you know, and also leveraging Richard Branson, Richard Branson has successfully built businesses, you know, and he says that clients sometimes doesn't always come first, you know, the staff or the employee comes first. Because if you take care of the employee, they will take care of the business. And it's so true, it's so true. So there is no point emphasising or customer, that first customer is king. And the way you treat your staff, you know, doesn't empower them, you know, to treat your customers as king. So you want to really take some time to ensure that, you know, inside out, you know, your internal processes have positioned you to deliver service excellence. So also move into What's the process like? So the first is to show interest, and like we said, you know, it's about trying to think through what are the expectations of the customer. So if you have been able to show interest, then you demonstrate an understanding of what your customer or your client or your patient really wants out of your service, you design systems, processes and structure to respond. For instance, if there is long wait time, because this is very common with the health care practice. So whether you're running a pharmacy, you're in the hospital, you're running a lab, run an eye clinic, whatever it is, the the wait times are long, it's could be a turn off, that could be one reason where I'm going to move on to the next provider. So if you realise that people are wishing endlessly, we want to find out what is it is that there are not enough people at the booking level, what's your degree of automation to your team members have to carry files all about you know mismatching numbers, and all that busy or whatever consultants are not conscious, because we're not asking them to compromise quality for time, you know, what there should be some level of orientation that you know, other clients or other patients are waiting, so is it that you are short staffed, is it that because you are heavily manual, you know, so you want to design and if you whatever your results are, you want to deliver. So if you need to hire more staff, if you need to train your staff to improve their efficiency, if you need to invest in technology, whatever it is, you want to make sure that your business is positioned, like I said, to deliver service excellence. And also in talking about the attitude, you know, it's about empathy, your team member should be able to connect in listening, they should be able to relate with the customer, they should be able to go the extra mile. I give the analogy earlier about the recruitment process, you know, that just wants reckless abandon when it comes to the customer. So you're not thinking about your reputation in quotes, you know, your focus is to deliver happiness. So the team member should be able to go the extra mile but like I said, if you haven't made them happy, as an employer, then you can there's only so much you can ask or you can express then then also your system should be flexible. There is nothing more frustrating to hear that. This is that we do it too as a business What I
